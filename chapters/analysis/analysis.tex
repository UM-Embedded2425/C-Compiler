Given that the 8051 architecture is well known by the class, the analysis focuses on translating its
key functional elements into hardware modules suitable for FPGA implementation. Emphasis is placed 
on the modular division of tasks across the class, the interfaces between components, 
and the timing and control flow requirements that will shape later design decisions.

Each component is considered in terms of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Instruction set requirements and execution flow
    \item Memory access patterns and latency handling
    \item Peripheral interaction and I/O protocols
    \item Control logic and state transitions
\end{itemize}

This foundational understanding guides the design and verification steps in the subsequent
 phases of the waterfall model.
